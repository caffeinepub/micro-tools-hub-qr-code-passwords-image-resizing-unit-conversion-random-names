The diff includes a rewritten DEPLOYMENT.md, but the provided content snippet is truncated right after an opening code fence, so the acceptance criteria (valid Markdown, explicit runnable commands, and checklist items) cannot be confirmed from the diff summary. The diff also shows multiple unrelated frontend feature/page/library changes not requested by the BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "Although DEPLOYMENT.md is modified, the diff snippet shows it cut off immediately after an opening code fence (```), and does not show the required explicit commands, mainnet selection steps, or the full verification checklist.
