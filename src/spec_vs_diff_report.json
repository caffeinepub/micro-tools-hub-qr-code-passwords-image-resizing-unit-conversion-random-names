      "reason": "The new page and shared lib show time start/end state and time parsing/formatting utilities, but there is no evidence in the provided diff summary of any UI or logic for summing multiple durations, nor any input model for multiple duration entries. The relevant parts of NumberConversionToolsPage.tsx are truncated before the time duration section completes.",
