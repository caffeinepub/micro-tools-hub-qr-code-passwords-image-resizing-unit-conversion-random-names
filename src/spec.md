# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Deploy the current Micro Tools Hub build to the Internet Computer mainnet (ic) and verify the live deployment works as expected.

**Planned changes:**
- Deploy the current application build to the Internet Computer mainnet (`ic`) following `frontend/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- Perform brief post-deploy verification on mainnet for core Hub navigation, ad placeholder banner areas, and `/ads.txt` availability.

**User-visible outcome:** The app is live on Internet Computer mainnet serving the latest UI, with working Hub navigation, visible ad placeholder areas, and an accessible `/ads.txt` at the site root.
