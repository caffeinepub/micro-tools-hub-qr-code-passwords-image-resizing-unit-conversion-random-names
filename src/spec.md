# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Finalize the mainnet deployment guide so it provides complete, runnable steps to deploy Micro Tools Hub to the Internet Computer mainnet.

**Planned changes:**
- Complete and fix `frontend/DEPLOYMENT.md` so it is no longer truncated and renders as valid Markdown (including properly closed code fences).
- Add explicit, step-by-step commands for prerequisites setup, building the frontend, selecting the mainnet network, and deploying canisters with `dfx` to mainnet.
- Add a short post-deploy verification checklist to confirm the deployed app loads, tool pages are accessible, QR/password/name/unit/image tools function, and the AdSense script is present in the delivered HTML.

**User-visible outcome:** A complete `frontend/DEPLOYMENT.md` guide that a developer can follow end-to-end to deploy the app live on IC mainnet and verify the deployment.
